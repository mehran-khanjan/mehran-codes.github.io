Types of Accounts in Solana:
- **Program Accounts:** These accounts execute code on-chain. They are also known as Solana 
programs.

- **Storage Accounts:** These accounts function like separate files with a shared structure 
defined by a Solana program. They store the data or state of a program and can include 
metadata such as access restrictions.

- **Token Accounts:** These accounts track the balances of tokens and allow for the transfer
of tokens.
