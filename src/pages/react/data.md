# ReactJS

## Senior Front End Developer
1. Deep JavaScript/TypeScript Mastery

    Challenge: Understand advanced concepts like closures, prototypal inheritance, event loop, and memory management.

    Solution:

        Build projects using design patterns (Factory, Observer, Singleton).

        Learn TypeScript generics, decorators, and utility types.

        Example: Create a custom state management library.

2. React Advanced Patterns

   Challenge: Optimize performance and manage complex state.

   Solution:

        Master hooks (useMemo, useCallback, useReducer).

        Implement compound components, render props, and controlled/uncontrolled components.

        Example: Build a high-performance data table with virtualization.

3. State Management at Scale

   Challenge: Choose between Redux, Context API, Zustand, or React Query.

   Solution:

        Compare trade-offs (boilerplate, scalability, dev tools).

        Example: Migrate a legacy Redux app to Zustand + React Query.

4. Performance Optimization

   Challenge: Fix lazy loading, bundle splitting, and re-renders.

   Solution:

        Use React.memo, React.lazy, and Webpack code splitting.

        Audit apps with Lighthouse and Chrome DevTools.

        Example: Reduce a 5MB bundle to under 1MB.

5. Testing & Debugging

   Challenge: Write maintainable tests and debug efficiently.

   Solution:

        Cover integration tests with Cypress and unit tests with Jest.

        Debug memory leaks with Chrome Heap Snapshots.

        Example: Achieve 80%+ test coverage for a Next.js app.

6. CSS Architecture

   Challenge: Scale CSS in large apps (BEM, CSS-in-JS, Tailwind).

   Solution:

        Compare CSS Modules vs. Styled Components.

        Implement design systems with Storybook.

        Example: Build a themable UI library.

7. SSR/SSG (Next.js, Remix)

   Challenge: Optimize SEO and server-side rendering.

   Solution:

        Master Next.js getServerSideProps/getStaticProps.

        Example: Deploy a Next.js app with ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration).

8. Web Security

   Challenge: Prevent XSS, CSRF, and data leaks.

   Solution:

        Sanitize inputs with DOMPurify.

        Implement CSP headers.

        Example: Secure a login form with JWT and HTTP-only cookies.

9. CI/CD & DevOps Basics

   Challenge: Automate deployments and testing.

   Solution:

        Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing.

        Configure Docker for frontend apps.

        Example: Deploy a React app to AWS S3 with GitHub Actions.

10. Soft Skills

    Challenge: Lead projects and mentor juniors.

    Solution:

        Practice giving code reviews and writing RFCs.

        Example: Document a technical decision (e.g., “Why we chose Vite over CRA”).

Bonus: System Design

    Challenge: Architect a frontend monorepo.

    Solution:

        Learn TurboRepo or Nx.

        Example: Split a monolithic app into micro-frontends
