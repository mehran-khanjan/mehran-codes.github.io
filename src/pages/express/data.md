# Express

## Senior Back End
:
1. Mastery of Core Backend Languages & Frameworks

   Challenge: Go beyond syntax and understand performance trade-offs.

   Solutions:

        Java: Master Spring Boot, JVM tuning, and concurrency (e.g., CompletableFuture).

        Node.js: Deepen knowledge of event loop, worker threads, and Express/Fastify.

        Python: Optimize Django/Flask apps with async (e.g., ASGI vs. WSGI).

        Go: Learn goroutines, channels, and high-performance HTTP servers.

        Example: Build a REST API that handles 10K+ RPM with <50ms latency.

2. Database Design & Optimization

   Challenge: Scale databases efficiently and avoid bottlenecks.

   Solutions:

        SQL: Optimize queries (indexes, CTEs, partitioning), and master PostgreSQL window functions.

        NoSQL: Design schemas for MongoDB/Cassandra (denormalization vs. joins).

        Caching: Implement Redis/Memcached for high-throughput systems.

        Example: Reduce a 2-second query to <100ms using indexing and query refactoring.

3. API Design & Architecture

   Challenge: Build scalable, maintainable APIs.

   Solutions:

        REST: HATEOAS, versioning, and idempotency.

        GraphQL: Optimize resolvers with DataLoader to avoid N+1 queries.

        gRPC: Implement bidirectional streaming for real-time apps.

        Example: Migrate a REST API to GraphQL while reducing payload size by 40%.

4. System Design & Scalability

   Challenge: Design systems that handle 1M+ users.

   Solutions:

        Load Balancing: NGINX, HAProxy, or cloud-based (ALB).

        Microservices: Decompose monoliths (e.g., Kubernetes + Istio).

        Event-Driven: Kafka/RabbitMQ for async processing.

        Example: Design a ticket-booking system that scales for Black Friday traffic.

5. Security & Compliance

   Challenge: Protect systems from breaches and ensure compliance.

   Solutions:

        OWASP Top 10: Prevent SQLi, XSS, CSRF.

        Auth: OAuth2.0, JWT hardening, and RBAC/ABAC.

        GDPR/HIPAA: Implement data encryption and audit logs.

        Example: Secure a payment API with PCI-DSS compliance.

6. DevOps & Cloud Infrastructure

   Challenge: Deploy and monitor high-availability systems.

   Solutions:

        IaC: Terraform/Pulumi for AWS/GCP.

        CI/CD: GitHub Actions/GitLab CI with canary deployments.

        Observability: Prometheus/Grafana for metrics, OpenTelemetry for tracing.

        Example: Automate zero-downtime deployments for a banking app.

7. Testing & Reliability

   Challenge: Ensure fault tolerance and reduce MTTR.

   Solutions:

        Unit/Integration Tests: Jest, PyTest, or JUnit.

        Chaos Engineering: Simulate failures with Gremlin.

        SLA/SLOs: Define and monitor uptime (e.g., 99.99%).

        Example: Implement retry/circuit-breaker patterns in a distributed system.

8. Performance Optimization

   Challenge: Debug latency and throughput issues.

   Solutions:

        Profiling: Flame graphs (Java Flight Recorder, pprof).

        Concurrency: Thread pools, connection pooling (HikariCP).

        Example: Reduce API response time from 500ms to 50ms through profiling.

9. Leadership & Soft Skills

   Challenge: Mentor teams and drive technical decisions.

   Solutions:

        Code Reviews: Focus on scalability and maintainability.

        RFCs: Write proposals for architectural changes.

        Example: Lead migration from monolithic to microservices architecture.
